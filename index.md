##Usage

To display the available command, just enter `pb_tool` on the command line:

    $ pb_tool
    Usage: pb_tool [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

      Simple Python tool to compile and deploy a QGIS plugin. For help on a
      command use --help after the command: pb_tool deploy --help.

      pb_tool requires a configuration file (default: pb_tool.cfg) that declares
      the files and resources used in your plugin. Plugin Builder 2.6.0 creates
      a config file when you generate a new plugin template.

      See https://github.com/g-sherman/plugin_build_tool/blob/master/test_plugin
      /pb_tool.cfg for an example config file. You can also use the create
      command to generate a best-guess config file for an existing project, then
      tweak as needed.

    Options:
      --help  Show this message and exit.
